## 🧑‍💻 Code Walkthrough

### 1. **Main Game Logic** (`MainWindow.xaml.cs`)

- The **GameController class** manages the wheel's prizes and determines the winning segment based on the wheel's final angle.

```csharp
public (int prizeAmount, bool isWin) SpinWheel(double stopAngle)
{
    int prizeIndex = DeterminePrizeIndexFromAngle(stopAngle);
    int prizeAmount = (int)segmentPrizes[prizeIndex];
    bool isWin = prizeAmount == selectedPrizePrediction;

    return (prizeAmount, isWin);
}
```

### 2. **Wheel Animation** (`SpinWheelWithTicks`)

- **Smooth rotation** animation is achieved with a `DoubleAnimation` and easing.

```csharp
DoubleAnimation spinAnimation = new DoubleAnimation
{
    From = 0,
    To = 360 * 5 + stopAngle,
    Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(3)),
    EasingFunction = new CircleEase { EasingMode = EasingMode.EaseOut }
};
```

### 3. **Confetti Animation**

- Randomly colored confetti pieces fall with easing animation.

```csharp
DoubleAnimation fallAnimation = new DoubleAnimation
{
    From = -10,
    To = ConfettiCanvas.ActualHeight + 10,
    Duration = new Duration(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(random.Next(1500, 3500) / 1000.0)),
    EasingFunction = new CircleEase { EasingMode = EasingMode.EaseInOut }
};
```

### 4. **Sound Integration**

- The game uses **MediaPlayer** to play the ticking sound as the wheel rotates.

```csharp
tickPlayer.Open(new Uri(tickSoundPath, UriKind.Absolute));
```
